# NodeJS Basics

Welcome to NodeJS Basics! This project is an introduction to the fundamental concepts of Node.js. You'll learn how to execute JavaScript code on the server, create HTTP servers, use Node.js modules, and much more.

## 📋 Content

### Execute JavaScript with Node.js
- 🚀 **Explanation**: Learn how to execute JavaScript code on the server using Node.js. This will allow you to write server-side applications and perform I/O (input/output) operations.
  
### Create HTTP Servers
- 🌐 **Explanation**: Learn how to create simple HTTP servers using the http module in Node.js. This will allow you to create basic web applications that can handle requests and send responses to clients.
  
### Use Node.js Modules
- 📦 **Explanation**: Learn how to use modules in Node.js to organize and reuse your code. Node.js provides a built-in module system that allows you to divide your application into smaller, modular files.
  
### Read Files with fs
- 📂 **Explanation**: Learn how to read and write files using the fs (File System) module in Node.js. This will allow you to perform input/output operations with files on your local file system.
  
### Access Command Line Arguments and Environment with process
- 💼 **Explanation**: Learn how to access command line arguments and environment variables using the process object in Node.js. This will allow you to pass information to the program from the command line or from the environment in which it's running.
  
### Create an HTTP Server with Express.js
- 🌟 **Explanation**: Learn how to create more advanced web servers using Express.js, a web framework for Node.js. Express.js simplifies the process of creating web servers and handling routes.

## 🎯 Project's  Objective

Learn the fundamentals of Node.js and how to use it to develop server-side applications, understanding its architecture and the available tools for building web applications.
